## My process

For this particular project, I set out to work from a mobile-first perspective. This methodology has always been much easier for me, since I can define what the main elements are, integrate them correctly and then resize the style of the components using media queries. I worked on the project in my spare time throughout the day to practice and improve my HTML and CSS skills. I hope you like it and I am attentive to any question or suggestion you have. Cheers!

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

As I mentioned before, I thought of this project as an opportunity to improve my HTML and CSS skills and even try some more creative solutions. I believe that these types of projects are essential to keep the knowledge current and show my skills to the developer community. For now, all that remains is to keep practicing, practicing, and practicing.

### Continued development

I'm currently working on other FrontendMentor projects, but haven't officially uploaded them yet. I think it's a great way to demonstrate my skills and abilities. On the other hand, I am also taking a JavaScript course to be able to add more interactivity to my designs. I hope to be able to show some of that soon.
